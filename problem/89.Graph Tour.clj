; Starting with a graph you must write a function that returns true if it is possible to make a tour of the graph in which every edge is visited exactly once.

; The graph is represented by a vector of tuples, where each tuple represents a single edge.

; The rules are:

; - You can start at any node.
; - You must visit each edge exactly once.
; - All edges are undirected.
